# Vanilla RNN: Recurrent Neural Networks

Welcome to the Vanilla RNN repository! Here, we delve into the fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a key building block in the world of sequence modeling and prediction.

## What is RNN?

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a specialized neural network designed for processing sequential data. It is particularly well-suited for tasks such as speech recognition, language modeling, and time series prediction. RNNs maintain an internal state, or "memory," which allows them to process sequences of inputs while retaining information about previous inputs.

### Understanding the Architecture:

The architecture of a Recurrent Neural Network differs from a traditional feedforward neural network due to its feedback loop. In an RNN, each input \(x(t)\) at time step \(t\) is processed along with the internal state from the previous time step \(h(t-1)\). This allows RNNs to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.

For example, in predicting the price of ice cream over several days, the RNN takes inputs \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\) along with corresponding weights \(w_1, w_2, w_3\) and biases \(b_1, b_2\). At each time step, the input is processed through an activation function and combined with the previous state to generate the current output. This process continues iteratively, with the output influencing future predictions.

### Challenges with RNN:

One common challenge with RNNs is the vanishing/exploding gradient problem. Due to the recurrent nature of RNNs, gradients can become extremely small (vanishing) or large (exploding) during training, making it difficult to update the model parameters effectively.
